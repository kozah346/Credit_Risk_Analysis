# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The following machine learning analysis is based on a real-world challenge in the form of credit card risk. Credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, this analysis will employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes including **imbalanced-learn** and **scikit-learn** libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Oversampling the data will happen using **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE** algorithms and undersampling will use **ClusterCentroids** algorithm. Then, a combinatorial approach of over/undersampling is used by the **SMOTEENN** algorithm. A comparison is then made by two new machine learning models that reduce bias namely, **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**, to predict risk. An evaluation is then done on the perfomance of these models and a written recommendation as to whether they should be used to predict risk.
